Hello Marker, hope you enjoy this relaxing game
I created this simple game to help people relax

The game consist in trying to walk around the edges without falling, the 
trick thing is that you can't really see the ground, so be careful!

-First you need to click at the box, it will change colors as long as you keep clicking, everytime you reload the boxes change colors aswell.

- Second you can go to the border just clicking the mouse and it will change 
colors too, and than you the arrow keys to move or just use the arrow keys without
clicking the mouse.

Good luck!
